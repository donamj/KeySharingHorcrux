# KeySharing

The key idea was the implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm.The data was encrypted using AES encryption.

The project is intended for organizations which have to ensure security for data that is
being accessed by multiple users. The data is encrypted using AES algorithm and stored
in cloud. The keys are divided into multiple shares and distributed among the users.
Threshold number of key shares is required to regenerate the key and the threshold
value is set depending upon the security level of the data. The sharing of key is done
through android application. The project is developed using java and android.
